            <strong id="Assertion">Assertion</strong>
            is used in automated testing to assert the expected behavior of the test. An assertion fails if the result
            is different than what you expected it to be. This is a key concept in functional testing. Assertions are
            commonly used in Unit testing, but the same concept applies to other forms of automated test.
         </p>

         <p>
            <strong id="Automated testing">Automated testing</strong>
            describes any form of testing where a computer runs the tests rather than a human. Typically, this means
            automated UI testing. The aim is to get the computer to replicate the test steps that a human tester would
            perform. There's also testautomation which means the process of automating what a human does when manually
            testing.

            <strong id="Bug">Bug</strong>
            is a problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid output. The problem is caused by insufficient or
            erroneous logic. bug can be an error, mistake, defect, or fault, which may cause failure or deviation from
            expected results.

            <strong id="zero">Cross Browser Testing</strong>
            allows you to verify your application's compatibility with different browsers. It's essential to any
            development process because it ensures that your product works for all users, regardless of their browser
            preferences.

            <strong id="zero">End to End testing aka e2e</strong>
            is a software testing technique that scrutinizes the functioning of a software/application from the start to
            the end. It dissects the overall flow of the software and how it functions in different environments. It
            also checks if the application flow is as expected. Tests should mimick real world user journeys where a
            user
            interacts with the website displayed in a browser.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Expected result</strong>
            is the anticipated outcome or behavior of a test case when it is executed against a particular set of inputs
            or conditions. The expected result is defined based on the requirements, specifications, or user
            expectations for the software or system being tested.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="Error">Error</strong>
            is a difference between what the software is supposed to do or is expected to do and what the software does.
            defect in the software can result in erroneous behavior.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Execution</strong>
            is simply performing (executing) the tests to verify specific functionality. This could be either manual
            test execution - where a person follows all the steps documented in the test cases. Or Automated test cases
            - where the command is given to execute (run) the steps using an automation tool.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">False-positive test</strong>
            in software testing is one where the test fails incorrectly. Typically, this is because of an error in the
            test itself, rather than a failure in the system. In automated testing, such failures are common and result
            in the need for Test maintenance.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">False-negative</strong>
            in software testing is a test that incorrectly passes despite the presence of an issue. Typically,
            false-negative results happen when the expected result hasn’t been correctly defined. This can be a common
            problem in UI testing, where tests fail to check the whole UI for errors.

         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Front-end testing</strong>
            is a type of testing that involves checking the user interface (UI) and how it interacts with the other
            layers in an application. It's also called "browser testing," "front-end validation," and "functional
            testing."

         <p>
            <strong id="Preconditions">Preconditions</strong>
            refer to the specific conditions or states that must be satisfied or met before a test can be executed.
            These conditions ensure that the test environment is set up correctly, providing a stable and consistent
            foundation for the test case. Preconditions help create a controlled and predictable testing environment,
            allowing testers to focus on the specific functionality or behavior being tested.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero"> Quality Assurance</strong>
            is the process of ensuring that the product or service provided to customers is of the best possible
            quality. Qfocuses on improving processes for delivering quality products.

            <strong id="zero">Selector</strong>
            is used by test scripts to identify and choose objects on the screen. These are then used to perform some
            action such as clicking, entering text, etc. There are various forms of selectors that are commonly used.
            These include simple HTML IDs, CSS-selectors and XPath queries.

            are used to develop and execute a variety of tests and compare the actual results against the expected
            results. It can be used for manual processes or as part of a continuous integration system. Selenium,
            Playwright,
            Cypress and many more but the three mentioned are the ones used most frequently.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test case</strong>
            is a fully documented specification of the inputs, execution conditions, testing procedure, and expected
            results for one possible outcome of a particular test. Test cases ensure that all areas of the program have
            been evaluated and that no errors were missed during testing.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test coverage</strong>
            tells you how much of your program’s code has been checked by tests. To figure this out, testers look at
            which parts
            of the code run when they run a test. They also check if all the “if” and “else” paths in the code have been
            used
            during testing.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test data</strong>
            means the information you give to a program during testing. This data is used to check if the program works
            correctly.
            Testers use different kinds of data—normal data and data that might cause errors—to make sure the program
            can handle
            all situations properly. That’s why it’s important to test with a variety of inputs.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test log</strong>
            the logging of a particular test.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test Runner</strong>
            is a tool that automates the execution of test cases and collects their results. It is frequently used in
            software testing to ensure that applications operate correctly and are bug-free. Test runners can be
            graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command line tools.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test Scenario</strong>
            is a high-level description of what needs to be tested in the software application to ensure its correct
            functionality and performance. It outlines a specific flow of actions or events (sequence), providing a
            clear image of how a feature or function should work under various conditions.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test Script</strong>
            is a set of instructions or lines of code written to verify if a software application functions as expected.
            It is a crucial component in automated testing, where it helps in executing a series of tasks and comparing
            the expected with the actual outcome.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Test suite</strong>
            is a set of tests and test cases designed to work together. Typical projects have several test suites for
            things like regression testing, smoke testing, and performance testing.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">UI / GUI</strong>
            a (graphical) user interface that makes interacting between user and computer possible.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">UI Testing</strong>
            testing the (graphical) user interface (UI) of the application to ensure it functions correctly and meets
            design specifications.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="zero">Use case</strong>
            describes how an actor or user uses the system. It is widely used to develop systems or acceptable level
            tests.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong id="User scenario">User scenario</strong>
            is a sequence of steps that a user of the software in irl needs to follow in order to use a specific
            funtionality. Let's say you want to test if a user can change his password. The user scenario will involve
            all the steps from login to go to his account and change the password and all necessary steps in between.

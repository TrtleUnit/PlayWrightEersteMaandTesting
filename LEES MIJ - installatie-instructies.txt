INSTALLATION

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ask your team-lead for help even if you know how to install software.

To get the repo working, you still need to install Node.js and Playwright for node.js.
You also need to install two extensions in vs-code.

VS-CODE EXTENSIONS  
Install these two:
1. 'vs-code-pdf' and 
2. 'Playwright Test for vs-code'.

NODE.JS 
Install in directory PlaywrightEersteMaand: node.js

PLAYWRIGHT 
Install in directory testsoftware: Playwright
During the installation of Playwright you're presented with a few
options:
- TypeScript or JavaScript? Choose TypeScript
- Tests folder name. Use tests
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow? no
- Install Playwright browsers? yes
- Overwrite Playwright.config.ts? no

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Remind your team lead that he probably needs this commando after installing
Playwright and trying to run a test:

'Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser'

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Useful terminal commands: 
- install project dependencies: npm install 
- check version Playwright: npx playwright --version
- check version Node: npm -v
- switch directory from PlaywrightEersteMaand to testsoftware: cd testsoftware
- switch directory from testsoftware to PlaywrightEersteMaand: cd ..
